# Final Project (Oct. 12 - Oct 31)
This is going to serve as a planning reference for my project. I am planning to work on a **Project
Management Tool**. I am going to build a Spring Boot Application that will implement an API which will
get data from a mySQL Local Server and provide them to my React App to display.

## Core Functionality > Back-end: API Side
I am going to focus first on building some core aspects of the project and if these are done and 
there is still time left, then I will move on into extending this functionality. My first focus is
to be able to have a user create a workspace where he can organise the progress of his project using
task lists and tasks.

### ER Diagram
A user has an email and a display name. A user can have workspaces. A workspace has a name, a start date
and an end date for its project. A workspace can contain many task lists. A task list has a name and a 
position. Each task list consists of different tasks. A task has a name, a position and a description.

### Plan with Hive
I am going to use Hive to manage the progress of my project. This way I can be more organised about
the planning process and at the same time experiment live with a tool similar to what I am developing.
